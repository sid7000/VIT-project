# Project Title 
Automated Sludge Level detector
## Aim
To develop a prototype that detects sludge in water tanks using a microcontroller.
## Project execution
1. Ultrasonic Sensor Setup:
Connections:
VCC to 5V on the microcontroller.
GND to GND on the microcontroller.
Trig to a digital pin 10 on the microcontroller.
Echo to a digital pin 11 on the microcontroller.

2. LED setup:
Connect a resistor to the anode of the LED and connect the other end of the resistor to digital pin 13.
Connect the cathode to GND on the microcontroller.

3. Testing the Prototype
Assemble the circuit on a breadboard.
Upload the code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE or appropriate software.
Test the sensor by placing it at various distances from the sludge surface and verify the readings.
Test the alert mechanism to ensure it activates when the sludge level exceeds the threshold.

4. Refining the Prototype
Adjust the sensor position: Ensure accurate detection of sludge level.
Fine-tune the threshold: Modify the code to set an appropriate distance for the alert.
Power considerations: If using a battery, ensure it has sufficient capacity for the expected operational period.

5. Enclosure and Deployment
Mount the components: Place the microcontroller, sensor, and alert mechanism in an enclosure.
Install the sensor: Securely place it in the water tank to measure the sludge level accurately.
Deploy the prototype: Place the assembled prototype near the water tank and monitor its performance.





## Program execution
1. Initialization: Set up the hardware connections and initialize variables.
2. Sensor Triggering and Echo Measurement: Measure the distance using the ultrasonic sensor to detect the sludge level.
3. Distance Calculation: Calculate the distance between the sensor and the sludge surface.
4. Threshold Check: Compare the measured distance to a predefined threshold.
5. Alert Activation: Trigger an alert if the sludge level exceeds the threshold.
6. Loop: Repeat the process continuously to ensure real-time monitoring
